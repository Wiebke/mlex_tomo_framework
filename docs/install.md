# How do I install and configure?


## Prerequisites
A container framework that supports docker-compose.yml files (docker + docker-compose or podman + podman/docker-compose)

## Environment Variables
The `docker-compose.yml` file uses enviornment variables. And easy way to set that up is to create an `.env`. An example file is included in `.env.example`. Rename this to `.env` and replace with your own values.
